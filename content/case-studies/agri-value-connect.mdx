# The Vision

Agriculture in East Africa suffers from severe supply-chain fragmentation. Farmers produce yields but lack direct market access, leading to massive post-harvest losses. Agri-Value-Connect was architected to solve this asymmetry by acting as a digital escrow and marketplace.

## The Architecture

Building a multi-sided B2B marketplace requires a rock-solid relational database and transactional integrity. I opted for a **PostgreSQL** database managed through the **Prisma ORM**, ensuring all supply and demand data is strictly typed and relationship-bound.

### Key Technical Achievements
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented NextAuth.js to handle complex, distinct portals for Farmers, Buyers, and System Administrators.
2. **Transactional Safety**: Engineered SQL transactions to ensure that when a buyer places an order, the farmer's inventory is atomically decremented, preventing double-selling.
3. **Responsive Operations Console**: Built a complex internal dashboard using Tailwind CSS and Recharts to allow admins to visualize GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) and user growth in real-time.

## The Result

Agri-Value-Connect demonstrates my ability to take a complex real-world supply chain problem and architect a structured, secure, and scalable web platform that handles money and livelihoods.

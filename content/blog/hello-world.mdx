Welcome to the first post on **MIKESTH3TIC.DEV**! 

Building a personal platform in 2024 requires more than just a list of projects. It requires a statement of intent. My goal for this site was to build something that feels like a startup product: high performance, interactive, and beautifully engineered.

## The Tech Stack

I chose a stack that allows for fast iteration without sacrificing user experience:

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)**: The gold standard for modern React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, consistent styling.
- **Framer Motion**: To bring the UI to life with high-fidelity animations.
- **Firebase**: For real-time functionality and effortless authentication.
- **Three.js**: To add that futuristic, "high-tech" feel to the hero section.

```typescript
// Next.js components are server-first by default!
export default function BlogPost() {
  return <div>Welcome to the future of web dev.</div>;
}
```

## Why MDX?

I decided to use MDX for the blog because it allows me to write standard Markdown but still embed React components directly into the content if needed. This makes technical tutorials much more interactive.

> Performance is not an ornament; it's the foundation of a great user experience.

### What's next?

I'll be posting regularly about AI, full-stack architecture, and my journey as an IT student in Nairobi. Stay tuned!

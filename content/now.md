I am currently finishing my final year as an IT student, focusing on advanced computing and software engineering principles.

My main focus is growing **MIKESTH3TIC.DEV** into a premium digital studio that helps startups launch faster with better technology.

I'm deep-diving into AI integration patterns, specifically how to build efficient, autonomous agents using modern LLMs and vector databases.

Learning more about Three.js and WebGL to create even more immersive web experiences for my clients.

Living in Nairobi, drinking probably too much coffee, and trying to stay physically active between coding sessions.
